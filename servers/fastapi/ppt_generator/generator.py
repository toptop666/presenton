                    - Adhere to length contraints in **body** and **description**. Focus on direct communication within character constrainsts than lengthy explanation.

                    - Descriptions should not use words like "This slide", "This presentation".
                    - If **body** contains items, *choose number of items randomly between mentioned constraints.*
