**Presenton** is an open-source AI presentation generator that runs entirely on your local machine. Built as a powerful alternative to cloud-based tools like Gamma, Presenton offers you complete ownership of your data and full control over how presentations are generated.

With seamless support for multiple large language models (LLMs)—including **OpenAI**, **Google Gemini**, and **Ollama**—you can generate high-quality, customizable slide decks from simple prompts or uploaded documents. Export your output in **PPTX** or **PDF** format and, when using Ollama, enjoy GPU-accelerated, fully offline generation with open-source models.

Presenton is designed around three core principles:

- **Simplicity** – No complex setup or vendor-specific tooling.

- **Flexibility** – Choose your preferred LLM, define your own themes, and fine-tune the generation workflow.

- **Transparency** – No telemetry, no vendor lock-in, and no hidden costs.

Whether you're building technical presentations, summarizing reports, or creating educational materials, Presenton empowers you to work **securely**, **efficiently**, and **on your own terms**—with complete freedom over your infrastructure, APIs, and data.

Join the open-source movement and redefine how presentations are made—\*\*your slides, your way.\*\*
